# **Multi-threaded Implementation of Merge Sort and Quick Sort**

### Base Merge-Sort/Quick-Sort code taken form Geeksforgeeks

### Compare time between Merge Sort and Quick sort
#### Quick Sort provides 2.5x speedup compared to Merge Sort
#### CPU Intel core i7-9750H 6C/12T 4Ghz all core
#### 8 Threads spawned for sorting and arrays merged with merge tree
### As Tested with 40960k long int(s):
    Quick sort ≃ 1 sec
    Merge sort ≃ 2.5 sec
